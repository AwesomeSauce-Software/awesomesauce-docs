# Gooftuber Editor

This is the Avatar Editor for Gooftuber Studio. It's fully integrated and can run as a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).

## Downloads
The recommended way to run Gooftuber Editor is using the PWA hosted under [edit.awesomesauce.software](https://edit.awesomesauce.software/). It houses the following improvements over the Downloaded builds:

- Always up-to-date
- Can be installed using Chromium-based-Browsers.
- No install required

However, it does come with some disadvantages

- Not OS-integrated.
- Some features may be limited
- Slower performance, exsp. on large projects.

If you make Avatars a lot, the downloaded Version is recommended. It comes with an update-checker to make sure you aren't running old versions.
