# Future Plans

## Moving away from Gooftuber
This Product will retain all functionality for use with Gooftuber Studio, but it'll have more options for more kinds of art, for example, Minecraft Texture Pack editing

## Mobile optimization
A move inspired by the one above, I want to make the App work well for mobile devices for editing on-the-go.

### Status
- [ ] Drawers hide/adjust depending on screen size
- [ ] You can zoom/scale the editor
- [ ] Make sure APIs work as expected on mobile
